Now I'll use the code-simplifier agent to analyze and simplify this code.The code-simplifier agent completed its analysis and made simplifications to `init.zig`. Let me verify the changes and run tests to confirm everything works.The test failure appears to be a pre-existing flaky test (unrelated to the init changes - it's in `id/generator.zig`). Let me check the git diff and verify the init tests pass:The init tests pass (the stderr output is expected - it's from the test that verifies "init fails if already initialized"). The test failure we saw earlier is a pre-existing flaky test in `id/generator.zig` unrelated to the init command.

Let me run the full test suite a couple more times to confirm it's a flaky test:Tests pass now. Let me see what changes were made to init.zig and verify they are good simplifications:The simplifications look good. Now let me commit these changes:Simplification complete. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Simplified `src/cli/init.zig`:**

1. **Extracted `outputError()` helper** - Deduplicates the repeated JSON/text error output pattern that was used in 3 places

2. **Eliminated redundant path construction** - Previously built `issues_path` and `jsonl_path` separately for the same file; now reuses a single path

3. **Simplified existence check** - Condensed the labeled block logic from a switch statement to a simpler expression

**Net result:** -11 lines (69 -> 58 lines in the changed section), cleaner error handling pattern, no behavior changes.

Tests pass and the commit is recorded as `39c0696 refactor(cli): simplify init command code`.
