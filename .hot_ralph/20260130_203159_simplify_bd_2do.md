I'll review the recent code changes and simplify them. Let me start by examining what was modified.Now let me also look at the args.zig file to understand the full context of the CreateArgs and QuickArgs structures.Now let me look at the init.zig file to understand patterns used there for comparison.Now I have a good understanding of the code. Let me create a todo list and then run the tests to verify the current state before making any simplifications.The tests are still running. Let me check the output so far.
