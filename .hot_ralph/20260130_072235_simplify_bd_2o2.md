I'll help you review and simplify the code changes from the "Implement database schema creation" task. Let me start by examining the recent changes.Now let me read the full schema.zig file to understand the code better and identify potential simplifications.Now let me use the code-simplifier agent to analyze and simplify the code.The code-simplifier agent completed its work. Let me verify the changes were committed and review the final state.The simplification is complete. Here's the summary:

## Code Simplification Complete

**Commit:** `d80940a refactor: simplify schema.zig index creation and version constant`

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed hardcoded schema version** - The INSERT statement now uses `comptimePrint` to format `SCHEMA_VERSION` instead of a hardcoded `'1'`. This eliminates a maintenance bug where updating the constant wouldn't update the stored value.

2. **Consolidated index creation** - Replaced 11 repetitive `db.exec()` calls with a `const index_definitions` array and a simple loop. This makes adding/removing indexes a single-line change and reduces code duplication.

### What Was Preserved

- All 16 schema tests pass
- Same behavior and functionality
- Same SQL statements executed
- Same table structures, constraints, and indexes

The changes are minimal and focused - no over-engineering, just removing duplication and fixing the version constant bug.
