I'll implement the dependency operations for issue dependencies including cycle detection. Let me start by exploring the existing codebase structure.Now let me also look at the schema to understand the database structure and the Issue model.Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me create the todo list and then implement the DependencyStore.Now let me create the `dependencies.zig` file with the DependencyStore implementation.Now let me update the mod.zig to export DependencyStore.Now let me run the tests to verify the implementation.I need to fix the ArrayList initialization. Zig 0.15 changed the API.I see - in the existing code, ArrayList is initialized with `.{}` instead of `.init()`. Let me fix the dependencies.zig file to match this pattern.Now let me also fix the detectCycles function which uses ArrayList:I see there are several ArrayList usages that need to be fixed. Let me fix them all at once.Now let me run the tests again:The tests are passing but there are memory leaks in the `wouldCreateCycle` function. The issue is that I'm allocating copies of strings for the visited hash map but not freeing them. Let me fix this:Now run the tests again:The memory leaks are fixed. There's a flaky test failure in id.generator (not related to my changes - it's a collision test that sometimes fails due to randomness). Let me run the tests again to verify my changes pass:All tests pass. Let me run them one more time to ensure stability:This is a pre-existing flaky test in `id/generator.zig` that sometimes fails due to randomness - it's not related to my changes. Let me run just the storage tests to confirm my implementation is working:The test filter doesn't seem to be working as expected - the id.generator test is still running. Let me check if this flaky test is a known issue and run the full test multiple times:The flaky test is failing quite often. Let me check if this pre-exists my changes by looking at the id generator test:This is a pre-existing flaky test. The issue is that with only 3-character hashes, the collision probability is too high when generating 100 IDs without using a deterministic seed. This is not related to my changes.

Let me verify that my changes compile correctly and run a targeted test for dependencies only:The build succeeds. The test failures are in an unrelated flaky test (`id.generator.test.generated IDs are unique`) which has a randomness-based collision that occasionally triggers when generating 100 IDs with only 3-character hashes.

Let me update the todo list and commit:Now let me commit the changes:The implementation is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

Created `src/storage/dependencies.zig` with `DependencyStore` implementing:

**Core Operations:**
- `add(dep)` - Add a dependency with self-dependency and cycle detection
- `remove(issue_id, depends_on_id)` - Remove a dependency
- `getDependencies(issue_id)` - Get what an issue depends on
- `getDependents(issue_id)` - Get what depends on an issue

**Cycle Detection:**
- `wouldCreateCycle()` - DFS-based check before adding dependency
- `detectCycles()` - Find all cycles in the dependency graph

**Query Operations:**
- `getReadyIssues()` - Open issues that are not blocked and not deferred
- `getBlockedIssues()` - Open issues with unresolved dependencies
- `getBlockers(issue_id)` - Get open issues blocking a specific issue

**Cache Management:**
- `invalidateBlockedCache()` - Invalidate cache when dependencies change
- `rebuildBlockedCache()` - Rebuild entire cache from dependencies
- `getCachedBlockers()` - Get cached blocker list for an issue

**Integration:**
- Updated `src/storage/mod.zig` to export `DependencyStore` and `DependencyStoreError`
- Dirty tracking integration for sync operations
- Comprehensive tests for all operations
