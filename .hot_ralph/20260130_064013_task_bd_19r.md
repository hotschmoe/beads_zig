I'll implement the Issue struct as specified. Let me first examine the existing model files to understand the current patterns and imports.Now I have a clear understanding of the patterns used in this codebase. I need to implement the Issue struct with:
1. All fields matching SPEC.md
2. Validation (empty title, title > 500 chars)
3. JSON serialization with RFC3339 timestamps
4. Clone and deinit for memory management
5. Equality checkI need to fix the timestamp formatting. The YearAndDay struct in Zig's standard library doesn't have a month field directly - I need to use a different approach.Let me check the Zig standard library's epoch module to understand the correct API.I see - `YearAndDay` doesn't have `toEpochDay()`. I need to calculate the epoch day manually. Let me fix the parsing function.The serialization is working but there's a mismatch with the expected values. I need to verify what timestamp 1706540000 actually corresponds to. Let me check.So 1706540000 is `2024-01-29T14:53:20Z`, not `2024-01-29T15:33:20Z`. The test expectations were wrong. Let me update the tests with the correct values.Now I need to also fix the parseRfc3339 test - the string and expected value need to match.The values should match now. Let me run the tests again.All tests pass. Let me update the todo list and commit the changes.The Issue struct has been successfully implemented. Here's a summary of what was created:

**Implementation Summary:**

1. **Created `src/models/issue.zig`** with:
   - `Issue` struct with all 27+ fields matching SPEC.md
   - `Rfc3339Timestamp` wrapper for serializing Unix epoch as RFC3339 strings
   - `OptionalRfc3339Timestamp` for nullable timestamp fields
   - `IssueError` for validation errors (EmptyId, EmptyTitle, TitleTooLong)

2. **Key methods:**
   - `validate()` - enforces title constraints (1-500 chars) and non-empty id
   - `eql()` - compares all issue fields except embedded relations
   - `clone()` - deep copies all fields including custom union variants
   - `deinit()` - frees all allocated memory
   - `init()` - creates issues with minimal required fields and sensible defaults

3. **JSON serialization:**
   - Timestamps serialize as RFC3339 format (e.g., `"2024-01-29T14:53:20Z"`)
   - All optional fields serialize as `null` when absent
   - Full roundtrip compatibility verified

4. **Updated `src/models/mod.zig`** to export:
   - `Issue`, `IssueError`
   - `Rfc3339Timestamp`, `OptionalRfc3339Timestamp`

5. **Validation passed:**
   - All tests pass with `zig build test`
   - Memory safety verified (clone/deinit don't leak)
