The code-simplifier agent reviewed the Comment struct implementation and made one simplification:

**Change made:**
- Simplified the `eql` function from 5 separate if-statements with early returns to a single return statement with chained `and` expressions. This is more concise and places integer comparisons first for short-circuit efficiency.

**No other changes needed** - the implementation was already clean with:
- Proper error type definition
- Consistent use of `const Self = @This()`
- Appropriate doc comments
- Comprehensive tests
- Correct JSON serialization approach
- Correct module export

All tests pass after the simplification.
