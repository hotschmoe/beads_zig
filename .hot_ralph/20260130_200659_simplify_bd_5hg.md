I've reviewed the output formatting module. The code is well-structured. Let me run the tests first to ensure everything works, then I'll look for simplification opportunities.There's an unrelated flaky test in the ID generator (collision detection test). Let me run the output module tests specifically.The output module tests are passing. The failure is in `id/generator.zig` - a flaky uniqueness test. Let me review the output module for simplification opportunities.

Looking at the code, I see several areas for potential simplification:

1. **Duplicated JSON write pattern** - `printIssueJson` and `printIssueListJson` are almost identical to `printJson`
2. **Duplicated file writes with newline** - Many methods write content then "\n" separately
3. **`checkNoColorEnv` efficiency** - It allocates an entire environment map just to check one variable

Let me make targeted simplifications:The output module tests are passing (327/328 passed, the failure is the same flaky ID generator test). Let me verify the output tests specifically work.Tests are passing. Let me verify the changes look correct by reading the modified sections.Done. I simplified the output formatting module with two changes:

1. **Removed duplicated JSON serialization** - `printIssueJson` and `printIssueListJson` now delegate to the existing `printJson` helper instead of duplicating the serialize-and-write logic (removed 8 lines)

2. **Simplified NO_COLOR check** - Changed from allocating an entire environment map (`std.process.getEnvMap`) to a direct lookup (`std.posix.getenv`), which is more efficient

Both changes preserve all functionality. The commit is `437ff1a`.
