I'll implement the DependencyType enum and Dependency struct for tracking relationships between issues. Let me start by exploring the existing codebase structure.Let me read the existing model files to understand the patterns being used.Now I have a good understanding of the patterns used. Let me create the dependency.zig file following the same conventions.I see there's a signal 11 (segfault) in one of the tests. This is likely related to how I'm handling the JSON parsing for the Dependency struct. Let me investigate and fix the issue.The issue is likely with the custom JSON stringify. When std.json parses back, it's looking for the standard struct format but I'm writing a custom format. Let me check how other similar tests work and fix the issue.

The problem is that when I provide a custom `jsonStringify`, the default `jsonParse` won't work because it uses `innerParse` which expects the automatic parsing logic but my custom serialization may have a different structure.

Let me simplify this by removing the custom `jsonStringify` for `Dependency` and letting std.json handle it automatically, which should work fine since all the nested types have their own serialization:All tests pass. Let me verify the test count includes our new tests:All 63 tests pass. Let me also verify our specific tests are in that count by checking the dependency.zig test count:We have 20 tests in our new file. Let me verify the final implementation is correct by reading the file:All validation criteria have been met. Now let me commit the changes:**Task completed successfully.**

## Summary

Implemented `DependencyType` enum and `Dependency` struct in `src/models/dependency.zig`:

**DependencyType** (`src/models/dependency.zig:10-97`):
- Union enum with 11 predefined types: `blocks`, `parent_child`, `conditional_blocks`, `waits_for`, `related`, `discovered_from`, `replies_to`, `relates_to`, `duplicates`, `supersedes`, `caused_by`
- Custom type support via `custom: []const u8`
- `toString()` / `fromString()` with case-insensitive parsing
- `eql()` for equality comparison
- JSON serialization via `jsonStringify`, `jsonParse`, `jsonParseFromValue`

**Dependency** (`src/models/dependency.zig:99-130`):
- Fields: `issue_id`, `depends_on_id`, `dep_type`, `created_at`, `created_by`, `metadata`, `thread_id`
- Deep equality via `eql()` method
- Automatic JSON serialization via std.json (leverages DependencyType's custom serialization)

**Exports** updated in `src/models/mod.zig:17-18`.

**Validation**:
- 20 tests added covering toString/fromString roundtrips, case-insensitivity, JSON serialization, null handling, and equality comparisons
- All 63 tests pass (`zig build test`)
