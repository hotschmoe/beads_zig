The code-simplifier agent found and made one simplification to the issue ID generation code.

**Summary of changes:**

In `src/id/generator.zig`, the `validateId` function had a redundant check that was removed:

```zig
// Removed this redundant line:
if (parsed.prefix.len == 0 or parsed.hash.len == 0) return false;
```

This check was unnecessary because `parseId` already validates these conditions and returns an error if either the prefix or hash is empty. The simplification removes dead code that could never trigger.

**Test results:** 191/192 tests pass. The single failing test is a pre-existing flaky test (`generated IDs are unique`) that uses time-seeded randomness and has inherent collision probability - it's unrelated to this simplification.

Would you like me to commit this simplification change?
