The code-simplifier agent completed the review and made two simplifications to `src/models/event.zig`:

**Changes made:**

1. **Removed unused `InvalidEventType` error variant** - This error was defined but never thrown anywhere in the code.

2. **Simplified the `eql` function** - Extracted the optional string comparison logic into a reusable `optionalStrEql` helper function, replacing the verbose labeled block pattern with idiomatic `orelse` handling.

All tests pass after these changes. Would you like me to commit these simplifications?
