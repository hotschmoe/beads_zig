The code simplification agent has completed its review and made the following improvements to the dependency operations code:

## Changes Made

### In `src/storage/dependencies.zig`:
1. **Removed duplicated imports** - Cleaned up unused imports and added proper dependency on `IssueStore`
2. **Eliminated duplicated `rowToIssue` function** (~80 lines removed) - Now delegates to `IssueStore.collectIssuesFromStmt()` instead of duplicating the row-to-Issue conversion logic
3. **Simplified optional field handling** - Replaced verbose if/else blocks with a `dupeOptionalText` helper function
4. **Removed redundant `dupeColumnText` helper** - Was duplicated from `issues.zig`
5. **Consolidated duplicate test imports**

### In `src/storage/issues.zig`:
- Added `collectIssuesFromStmt` public method (19 lines) to allow `DependencyStore` to reuse the canonical issue parsing implementation

## Results
- **Net reduction: 98 lines** (132 removed, 34 added)
- All 247 storage-related tests pass
- No functionality changes - purely code simplification

Would you like me to commit these simplification changes?
