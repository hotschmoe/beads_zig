The code simplification has been completed. Here's the summary:

## Simplification Results

**File modified:** `src/storage/sqlite.zig`

### Change Made
Removed code duplication between `exec` and `execAlloc` functions:
- Renamed `execAlloc` → `execZ` (following Zig convention for null-terminated string variants)
- Refactored `exec` to delegate to `execZ` instead of duplicating the error handling logic

This eliminates ~10 lines of duplicated code while preserving identical behavior.

### Test Results
All 8 SQLite-specific tests pass. There's a pre-existing flaky test in `src/id/generator.zig` (unrelated to this commit).

### What Was Kept
- The `Statement.db` field (appears unused but is a reasonable pattern for future error message retrieval)
- All other code structure - the implementation is already clean and well-organized

Would you like me to commit these simplification changes?
