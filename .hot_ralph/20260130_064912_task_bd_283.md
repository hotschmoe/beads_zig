I'll implement the RFC3339 timestamp utilities for JSONL compatibility. Let me start by understanding the current project structure.Let me read the existing models/mod.zig to understand how to integrate the timestamp module.I see that there are already `Rfc3339Timestamp` and `OptionalRfc3339Timestamp` being exported from `issue.zig`. Let me read the issue.zig to see what's already implemented.I see there's already a basic RFC3339 implementation embedded in `issue.zig`. The task is to create a separate `timestamp.zig` module with proper RFC3339 utilities. Let me analyze what's currently there and what additional functionality is needed:

Current implementation:
- `Rfc3339Timestamp` and `OptionalRfc3339Timestamp` wrappers for JSON serialization
- `parseRfc3339` function (handles basic format, but doesn't handle timezone offsets or fractional seconds)
- `yearMonthDayToEpochDay` helper

The task requires:
1. A separate `timestamp.zig` module
2. Proper `parseRfc3339` that handles timezone offsets and fractional seconds
3. `formatRfc3339` that formats to a buffer
4. `formatRfc3339Alloc` that allocates
5. `now()` function
6. Comprehensive tests including edge cases

Let me create the timestamp module with the enhanced functionality.Now let me update `src/models/mod.zig` to export the timestamp utilities.Now let me run the tests to verify everything works correctly.I need to fix the unused variable. The `secs` variable is not actually used after being defined. Let me fix this.Now let me run the tests again.I see the issue. The format string is producing a `+` sign for positive years. The format specifier `{d:0>4}` should just pad with zeros, but there seems to be an issue with how the year is formatted. Let me check the formatting more carefully.The issue is that the `year` is an `i32` (signed integer), and when printing, it's showing the `+` sign for positive values. I need to cast it to unsigned for the formatting. Let me fix this.All tests pass. Let me update the todo list and run a few more specific tests to confirm the functionality.Let me also run a specific test filter to verify the timestamp tests are passing.Now let me commit the changes.Task completed successfully.

**Summary:**

I implemented RFC3339 timestamp utilities in `src/models/timestamp.zig` with the following features:

1. **`parseRfc3339(s: []const u8) ?i64`** - Parses RFC3339 strings to Unix epoch seconds, returning null for invalid input (for compatibility)

2. **`parseRfc3339Strict(s: []const u8) TimestampError!i64`** - Same but returns specific errors (`InvalidFormat`, `InvalidDate`, `InvalidTime`, `InvalidTimezone`)

3. **`formatRfc3339(timestamp: i64, buffer: []u8) TimestampError![]const u8`** - Formats Unix epoch seconds to RFC3339 UTC string

4. **`formatRfc3339Alloc(allocator, timestamp: i64) ![]u8`** - Heap-allocated version

5. **`now() i64`** - Returns current time as Unix epoch seconds

**Supported formats:**
- UTC with Z suffix: `2024-01-29T15:30:00Z`
- Explicit UTC offset: `2024-01-29T15:30:00+00:00`
- Positive timezone offset: `2024-01-29T15:30:00+05:00`
- Negative timezone offset: `2024-01-29T15:30:00-05:00`
- Fractional seconds (ignored): `2024-01-29T15:30:00.123Z`

**Tests cover:**
- Basic parsing and formatting
- Timezone offset parsing
- Fractional seconds handling
- Invalid format/date/time rejection
- Leap year handling
- Negative timestamps (pre-1970)
- Year 2038+ timestamps
- Roundtrip verification

All 154+ tests pass. Commit: `60733ad`
