The code-simplifier agent reviewed and simplified the DependencyType and Dependency implementation. Here's what was changed:

## Simplifications Made

**1. `DependencyType.eql` function** - Made more idiomatic:
- Replaced `@typeInfo(Self).@"union".tag_type.?` with `std.meta.Tag(Self)` (cleaner API)
- Consolidated the final return into a single expression

**2. `Dependency.optionalStrEql` helper** - Simplified using `orelse`:
- Used early returns with `orelse` instead of explicit null checks
- More idiomatic Zig pattern for optional handling

All tests pass. The changes preserve functionality while making the code cleaner and more consistent with Zig conventions.

Would you like me to commit these simplifications?
