I'll implement the content hash generation for issue deduplication. Let me start by understanding the current project structure and the Issue model.Now let me look at the Status and Priority types to understand their `toString` methods:Now I have all the information I need. Let me create the content hash module. According to the SPEC, the content hash should include specific fields separated by null bytes.The function name has changed in the Zig version. Let me fix that:All tests pass. Let me update the todo list and commit the changes:Task completed successfully.

**Summary:**
- Created `src/id/hash.zig` with SHA256 content hashing for issue deduplication
- Hash includes all content-relevant fields per SPEC.md: title, description, design, acceptance_criteria, notes, status, priority, issue_type, assignee, owner, created_by, external_ref, source_system, pinned, is_template
- Fields are separated by null bytes (`\x00`) for unambiguous parsing
- Optional fields contribute empty string when null
- Output is 64-character lowercase hex string
- Updated `src/id/mod.zig` to export the hash module and functions
- All tests pass (including determinism, field sensitivity, null handling, and output format validation)
- Committed as `57d545e`
