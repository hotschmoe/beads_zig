Let me read the main file that was added to understand its structure.This is a comprehensive CLI argument parser. Let me also check the mod.zig file and run the tests to make sure everything works.The tests pass for the args.zig file (the code-simplifier focus). There's an unrelated flaky test in the id generator that's failing due to random collision. Let me verify the args.zig tests specifically pass.All 75 tests pass. Now let me review the code for simplification opportunities. I'll analyze the args.zig file for patterns that can be consolidated.Looking at the code, I can identify several simplification opportunities:

1. **Repetitive flag parsing patterns** - Many parse*Args functions have identical patterns for `--limit`/`-n` flags (parseReadyArgs, parseBlockedArgs, parseAuditArgs). These could use a helper.

2. **Repetitive required positional argument handling** - Many functions have similar patterns for parsing a required positional arg with optional flags.

3. **The `_ = self.next()` pattern** - After checking with `peek()`, the code does `_ = self.next()` to consume the flag name. This could be cleaner.

Let me implement some simplifications. I'll add helper methods to reduce repetition while keeping the code clear.Now let me refactor the parse*Args functions to use these helpers. Starting with the simpler ones:Now let me run tests to verify everything still works.Tests pass. Let me continue refactoring more functions to use the helpers. Let me look at the search and stale args which have similar patterns.I need to add the `peekPositional` helper:Let me now refactor parseStaleArgs using the helpers:Let me refactor parseCountArgs as well:Now let me refactor parseSyncArgs:Now let me refactor parseListArgs which has many similar patterns:Let me continue refactoring more functions. parseQuickArgs and parseCloseArgs have similar patterns:Let me also refactor parseUpdateArgs and parseCreateArgs which are more complex:Now let me refactor the remaining functions. Let me also look at the subcommand parsers:All tests pass. Let me also simplify parseCommentsArgs and parseConfigArgs:All tests pass. Let me update the todo list and check the git diff to see the changes:Significant reduction - 130 lines net reduction. Let me view a summary of the changes:The refactoring is clear and consistent. Now let me run the full build to ensure everything compiles:Now let me commit the changes:I've reviewed and simplified the CLI argument parser code. Here's a summary:

**Changes made:**

1. **Added 5 helper methods** to reduce repetition:
   - `skip()` - advance past a peeked argument
   - `consumeFlag(short, long)` - check and consume a flag in one step
   - `consumeU32()` - parse a u32 value after consuming a flag
   - `parseLimitFlag()` - common `--limit`/`-n` flag handling
   - `peekPositional()` - check if current arg is a positional (non-flag)

2. **Refactored 14 parse*Args functions** to use the helpers:
   - `parseInitArgs`, `parseCreateArgs`, `parseQuickArgs`, `parseCloseArgs`
   - `parseUpdateArgs`, `parseListArgs`, `parseReadyArgs`, `parseBlockedArgs`
   - `parseSearchArgs`, `parseStaleArgs`, `parseCountArgs`, `parseSyncArgs`
   - `parseAuditArgs`, `parseDepArgs`, `parseLabelArgs`, `parseCommentsArgs`
   - `parseConfigArgs`

3. **Standardized variable naming** - changed `args` to `result` for consistency

**Results:**
- Net reduction of **130 lines** (1751 -> 1621)
- All **75 unit tests pass**
- Build compiles successfully
- No behavior changes - purely cosmetic/structural improvements
