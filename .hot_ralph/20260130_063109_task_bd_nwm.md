I'll implement the Comment struct for issue comments. Let me start by examining the existing code structure to understand the patterns used.Now I understand the patterns. Let me create the Comment struct following the same conventions used in `dependency.zig`.Now let me update `mod.zig` to export the Comment type.Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation.The tests passed (no output means success with `zig build test`). Let me also run a specific test filter to confirm the Comment tests run.All tests pass. Let me verify the Comment module is properly recognized by running the test step for that specific module.All 15 tests pass:
- Validation tests (valid, empty body, empty author, empty issue_id, id=0)
- Equality tests (all fields, id difference, body difference, author difference)
- JSON serialization tests (roundtrip, multiline body, unicode body, expected fields, special characters, id=0)

Now let me commit the changes.Implementation complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Created `src/models/comment.zig`:**
- `Comment` struct with fields: `id`, `issue_id`, `author`, `body`, `created_at`
- `CommentError` error type with `EmptyCommentBody`, `EmptyAuthor`, `EmptyIssueId`
- `validate()` method to check required fields are not empty
- `eql()` method for deep equality comparison
- JSON serialization works via Zig's std.json (no custom jsonStringify/jsonParse needed since all fields are primitive types)

**Updated `src/models/mod.zig`:**
- Exports `Comment` and `CommentError`

**Tests (15 passing):**
- Validation: valid comment, empty body/author/issue_id, id=0 for new comments
- Equality: all fields, id/body/author differences
- JSON: roundtrip, multiline body, unicode, special characters, expected fields, id=0
