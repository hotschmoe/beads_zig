I'll review the recent code changes for the Status enum implementation and use the code-simplifier agent to analyze and potentially simplify the code.The code-simplifier agent reviewed the Status enum implementation and found it to be well-structured. Here's a summary:

## Files Reviewed
- `src/models/status.zig` - New Status enum implementation
- `src/models/mod.zig` - Module exports

## Change Made
One minor simplification: removed a redundant `// Tests` comment (test blocks in Zig are self-documenting via their string names).

## Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is already clean and well-structured:
- `union(enum)` pattern is appropriate for extensible status values
- `fromString` if-chain is readable for a small number of values
- Doc comments are concise and informative
- Tests are comprehensive with good edge case coverage
- `Self = @This()` pattern is idiomatic Zig
- Proper error handling with `error.UnexpectedToken`
- JSON serialization support via standard library hooks

**All tests pass.** The code is ready as-is with just the minor comment removal. Would you like me to commit this small simplification?
