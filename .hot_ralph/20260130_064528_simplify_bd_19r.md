The code-simplifier agent completed the review and made the following improvements to the Issue struct implementation:

**Simplifications made:**

1. **Replaced verbose error handling with idiomatic `try`** - Changed `catch |e| return e` patterns to simply use `try`, which is the standard Zig idiom for propagating errors.

2. **Removed redundant helper functions** - Deleted `optionalI64Eql` and `optionalI32Eql` helper functions (12 lines) because Zig's `==` and `!=` operators already work correctly with optional primitive types like `?i64` and `?i32`.

3. **Simplified equality comparisons** - Replaced calls to the removed helper functions with direct comparisons using `!=`.

**Result:**
- Net reduction of 12 lines of code
- All 132 tests pass
- Code is more idiomatic Zig
- No behavior changes

The simplification changes should be ready to commit. Would you like me to check the git status and commit the changes?
