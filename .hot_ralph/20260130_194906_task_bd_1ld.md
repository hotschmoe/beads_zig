I'll implement the CLI argument parser for beads_zig. Let me start by exploring the existing project structure.Let me also check the root.zig to see how modules are exported, and look at some models for reference.Now I have a good understanding of the project structure. Let me also check the issue_type model and then create the argument parser.Now let me create the argument parser. I'll implement it with comprehensive tests as specified.Now let me update the CLI module to export the args module.Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation.I need to fix the ArrayList API for this version of Zig. Let me check the correct usage.I see - in this Zig version, ArrayListUnmanaged is used directly without `.init()`. Let me fix the args.zig to use ArrayListUnmanaged properly.Now let me fix the label add/remove functions that also use ArrayList.Now let's run the tests again.The compilation works now. There are two issues:
1. Memory leaks in tests - the tests need to free the allocated labels slice
2. A flaky test in id/generator.zig (unrelated to our changes)

Let me fix the memory leaks in the label tests by properly freeing the allocated memory.I need to add defer to free the allocated labels in the tests.Now let me run the tests again.All tests pass now. Let me run the tests a couple more times to make sure there are no flaky tests.The test failure is in the id/generator module, which is unrelated to our CLI argument parser work. It's a flaky test that sometimes has ID collisions. Let me run just the cli tests to confirm our implementation is correct.The test filter isn't working as expected - all tests are running regardless. The flaky test in id/generator is causing issues. This is a pre-existing issue unrelated to the CLI argument parser. Let me check if we can run tests in a way that skips that specific test, or let's verify the build works.The build succeeds. Let me also verify the binary runs.The binary works. The tests pass but there's a pre-existing flaky test in `id/generator.zig` that occasionally fails due to ID collisions in the uniqueness test. This is unrelated to the CLI argument parser implementation.

Let me run the tests multiple times to verify our implementation is solid:The test results show that sometimes all tests pass (runs 2, 4, 5 where no failed tests are shown) and sometimes the id.generator test fails (runs 1, 3). This is a pre-existing flaky test, not related to our CLI implementation.

All 72 CLI argument parser tests pass consistently. Let me update the todo list and prepare the commit.Now let me create the commit.The CLI argument parser has been successfully implemented and committed. Here's a summary:

## Task Completed: Implement CLI argument parser

### Files Created/Modified:
- **`src/cli/args.zig`** (new, 1759 lines) - Complete argument parser implementation
- **`src/cli/mod.zig`** (modified) - Exports the args module

### Implementation Details:

**Data Structures:**
- `GlobalOptions` - Global CLI flags (--json, -q, -v, --no-color, --data, --actor, etc.)
- `Command` - Tagged union of all subcommands
- Argument structs for each command (CreateArgs, ListArgs, DepArgs, etc.)
- `ParseResult` - Combined global options and command
- `ArgParser` - Stateful parser that consumes args array

**Commands Supported:**
- Workspace: init, info, stats, doctor, config
- Issue CRUD: create/add/new, q/quick, show/get/view, update/edit, close/done/finish, reopen, delete/rm/remove
- Query: list/ls, ready, blocked, search/find, stale, count
- Dependencies: dep (add, remove, list, tree, cycles)
- Labels: label (add, remove, list, list-all)
- Comments: comments (add, list)
- Audit: history/log, audit
- Sync: sync/flush/export
- System: version, schema, completions
- Help: help, --help, -h

**Tests:**
- 72 unit tests covering all major functionality
- Global flag parsing
- Subcommand dispatch
- Required argument validation
- Flag combining (-vv)
- Command aliases
- Error cases

### Validation:
- `zig build` passes
- `zig build test` passes (note: there's a pre-existing flaky test in id/generator.zig unrelated to this change)
- Binary runs correctly
