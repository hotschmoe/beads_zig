I'll help you review and simplify the code changes made for the Priority struct implementation. Let me start by examining what was changed.The code-simplifier agent has completed the review and made several improvements to the Priority struct implementation. Here's a summary:

## Changes Made

1. **Condensed doc comments** - Reduced verbose multi-line comments to concise single-line descriptions for `fromInt`, `fromString`, and `compare` functions.

2. **Flattened `jsonParse` control flow** - Refactored a nested switch to extract the string first, then process linearly. This follows the early-return pattern more consistently and is clearer to read.

## What Was Preserved

- All functionality remains intact
- The `anytype` pattern in `fromInt` for compile-time flexibility
- The struct-based design necessary for JSON serialization as integer
- All test coverage
- Module-level documentation

All tests pass with `zig build test`.

Now let me commit these simplification changes:The simplification changes have been committed. Summary of the code review:

**Commit `eb8b605`** - Simplifications to `src/models/priority.zig`:

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Doc comments | Multi-line verbose | Concise single-line |
| `jsonParse` | Nested switch with logic inside | Flat control flow with early extraction |
| Lines | 14 lines | 9 lines |

All tests pass and functionality is preserved.
