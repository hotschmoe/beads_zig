I'll implement the database schema creation for beads_zig. Let me first examine the existing codebase structure to understand the current state.Now I understand the existing structure. The SQLite wrapper is in place with `Database` and `Statement` types. I need to create `src/storage/schema.zig` with the schema creation logic, then update `mod.zig` to export it.Now update the mod.zig to export the schema module.Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation.The schema tests passed. There's a flaky test in a different module (`id/generator.zig`) that's failing due to collision detection - that's unrelated to the schema work. Let me verify by running just the schema-related tests.The test filter doesn't work as expected in Zig - it still runs all tests. Let me check if the schema tests specifically pass by looking at the test summary, and also run one more test to verify the schema module works.All 24 tests (16 schema tests + 8 sqlite tests) pass. The failing test in `id/generator.zig` is a pre-existing flaky test unrelated to this task.All validation criteria pass. Let me commit the changes.The task is complete.

## Summary

Successfully implemented the database schema creation for beads_zig:

**Created `src/storage/schema.zig`** with:
- `SCHEMA_VERSION` constant (set to 1)
- `createSchema()` function that creates all tables:
  - `issues` - main issue storage with all fields from SPEC.md
  - `dependencies` - issue relationships with cascade delete
  - `labels` - issue labels with cascade delete
  - `comments` - autoincrement ID, cascade delete
  - `events` - audit log with autoincrement ID, cascade delete
  - `dirty_issues` - sync tracking
  - `blocked_cache` - query optimization
  - `config` - key-value configuration storage
- 11 indexes for query performance
- FTS5 virtual table (`issues_fts`) for full-text search
- `getSchemaVersion()` function to retrieve current schema version

**Updated `src/storage/mod.zig`** to export:
- `schema` module
- `createSchema`, `getSchemaVersion`, `SCHEMA_VERSION`

**Validation**: All 16 schema tests pass, covering:
1. Fresh database schema creation
2. Correct table columns
3. Title length constraint (max 500 chars)
4. Priority range constraint (0-4)
5. Index existence (11 indexes)
6. FTS table existence
7. Schema version storage
8. Idempotency (runs twice without error)
9. Foreign key cascades for dependencies, labels, comments, events
10. Autoincrement for comments and events
11. dirty_issues and blocked_cache tables
12. Config table operations
