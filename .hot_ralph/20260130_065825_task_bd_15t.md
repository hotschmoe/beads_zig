I'll implement the Base36 encoding/decoding module for issue ID hash generation.Now I'll create the base36.zig module and update mod.zig to export it.Now update mod.zig to export the base36 module.Now let's run the tests to validate the implementation.The tests passed (no output means success). Let me also run the tests with verbose output to confirm all base36 tests are being discovered and executed.All tests pass. Let me verify the tests are actually being run by adding a quick sanity check.All tests pass. Now let me commit the changes.**Task completed successfully.**

Summary of implementation:
- Created `src/id/base36.zig` with:
  - `encode()` - Stack-based encoding to buffer (lowercase output)
  - `encodeAlloc()` - Heap-allocated encoding 
  - `decode()` - Case-insensitive decoding (accepts both upper and lowercase)
  - `encodedLength()` - Calculate encoded length without encoding
  - Proper error handling for empty input, invalid characters, and overflow
  - Comprehensive tests covering all validation criteria

- Updated `src/id/mod.zig` to export the base36 module

All tests pass with `zig build test`.
