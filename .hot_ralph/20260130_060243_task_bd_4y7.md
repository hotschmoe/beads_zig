I'll implement the IssueType enum as specified. Let me start by examining the current project structure.Let me examine the existing model files to understand the patterns used.I have a good understanding of the patterns used. The Status type is a tagged union similar to what I need for IssueType. I'll create the IssueType implementation following the same patterns.Now let me update the mod.zig to export IssueType.Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation.All tests pass. Let me also run the tests with a filter to specifically verify our new module's tests are being executed.All 10 tests pass. Let me now verify the full build still works.The build succeeds. Now let me commit the changes.Task completed successfully.

**Summary:**
- Created `src/models/issue_type.zig` with the `IssueType` tagged union
- Implemented all 7 predefined types: task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question
- Supports custom types via the `custom: []const u8` variant
- Implemented `toString()` for converting to string representation
- Implemented `fromString()` with case-insensitive parsing for known types
- Implemented JSON serialization (`jsonStringify`, `jsonParse`, `jsonParseFromValue`)
- Added 10 comprehensive tests covering:
  - toString/fromString for all known types
  - Case-insensitive parsing
  - Custom type handling
  - Roundtrip tests
  - JSON serialization roundtrip
  - Verification that JSON serializes as lowercase string
- Updated `src/models/mod.zig` to export `IssueType`
- All tests pass (`zig build test`)
- Committed with message "Implement IssueType enum for issue categorization"
