I'll review the recent code changes for the Base36 encoding/decoding implementation and simplify where appropriate.The code simplifier agent has completed its review and made some minor simplifications. Let me verify the changes and run the tests to confirm everything works.Tests pass. Let me see the actual diff to confirm the simplifications look good.The simplifications look good - removed unnecessary `@as()` type casts in the test assertions. Tests pass, so let me commit these changes.## Summary

Reviewed and simplified the Base36 encoding/decoding implementation. The core implementation in `src/id/base36.zig` was already well-structured with:
- Clean `encode()` function with proper buffer handling
- Proper overflow checking in `decode()` using `std.math.mul` and `std.math.add`
- Clear separation between buffer-based and allocator-based APIs
- Good test coverage including edge cases

**Simplification made:** Removed 18 unnecessary `@as()` type casts in test assertions. Zig 0.15's `std.testing.expectEqual` has improved type inference, making explicit casts like `@as(u64, 10)` and `@as(usize, 1)` redundant.

Tests pass. Committed as `40727e1`.
