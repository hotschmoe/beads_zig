The code-simplifier agent reviewed the IssueType enum implementation from commit 9c96f4c and found that **no simplifications are needed**. The code is already:

- Clean and consistent with the codebase patterns (follows the same structure as `status.zig`)
- Free of unnecessary complexity
- Properly documented with appropriate comments
- Well-tested with good coverage
- Following Zig conventions

The tests pass successfully and there are no changes to commit.
