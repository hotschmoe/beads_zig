The code is clean and well-structured. Let me run the tests to verify everything works.The code review is complete. The code in commit 0b6c4a3 is already clean and well-organized:

**Review Summary:**

1. **main.zig** - Clean entry point, uses `std.fs.File.stdout()` correctly for Zig 0.15.2, includes a compile-time test to verify module imports

2. **root.zig** - Properly exports all modules, uses `std.testing.refAllDecls(@This())` to run tests from submodules

3. **Module files** (cli, config, id, models, output, storage, sync) - Each has:
   - Descriptive doc comments explaining purpose
   - Proper `const std = @import("std")` import
   - Test block with `std.testing.refAllDecls(@This())`

**No simplifications needed.** The code follows good practices:
- Consistent structure across all module files
- Clear, concise doc comments
- No dead code or unused imports
- Minimal boilerplate appropriate for skeleton files

Tests pass and the binary runs correctly. Nothing to commit.
