I'll implement the Event struct and EventType enum for the audit log system. Let me start by exploring the existing codebase structure.Let me examine the existing models to understand the patterns used.Now I understand the patterns. Let me create the `event.zig` file with EventType enum and Event struct.All tests pass. Let me also run a quick check to ensure the module exports work correctly.Task completed successfully.

**Summary:**

Implemented the Event struct and EventType enum for the audit log system in `src/models/event.zig`:

- **EventType enum**: Plain enum with 15 event types (created, updated, status_changed, priority_changed, assignee_changed, commented, closed, reopened, dependency_added, dependency_removed, label_added, label_removed, compacted, deleted, restored). Includes `toString()`, `fromString()`, and JSON serialization methods.

- **Event struct**: Contains id, issue_id, event_type, actor, old_value (optional JSON), new_value (optional JSON), and created_at timestamp. Includes:
  - `validate()` method for required field checks
  - `eql()` method for deep equality comparison
  - Factory functions: `issueCreated()`, `statusChange()`, `priorityChange()`, `assigneeChange()`, `labelAdded()`, `labelRemoved()`, `dependencyAdded()`, `dependencyRemoved()`, `issueClosed()`, `issueReopened()`, `issueDeleted()`, `issueRestored()`

- Updated `src/models/mod.zig` to export EventType, Event, and EventError.

- All tests pass (`zig build test`), including:
  - EventType toString/fromString roundtrip
  - Event JSON serialization roundtrip
  - Factory functions produce valid events
  - Tests with null old_value (for creation events)
