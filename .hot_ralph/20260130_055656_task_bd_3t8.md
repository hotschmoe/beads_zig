I'll implement the Priority struct for issue prioritization. Let me start by checking the current project structure and existing model files.Let me examine the existing model files to understand the patterns and structure.Now I'll create the Priority struct following the patterns established in status.zig but adapted for the integer-based priority system.Now let me update mod.zig to export Priority.Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation.I need to fix a few issues:
1. The error set issue with `jsonParse` - need to return the proper error type
2. ArrayList API has changed in Zig 0.15

Let me check the Zig version and the status.zig for how JSON serialization tests are done.Let me look at the JSON test pattern in status.zig more carefully - it uses `std.io.Writer.Allocating`.Now let me fix the ArrayList issue - need to use the newer API pattern.Now let me run the tests again.Tests passed with no output (successful). Let me verify by running with verbose output.All tests pass. Let me update the todo and commit the changes.**Task completed successfully.**

Summary of what was implemented:

1. Created `src/models/priority.zig` with the Priority struct:
   - `u3` value field constrained to 0-4 range
   - Constants: `CRITICAL` (0), `HIGH` (1), `MEDIUM` (2), `LOW` (3), `BACKLOG` (4)
   - `fromInt()` - converts integers with validation
   - `fromString()` - parses both names ("critical", "high", etc.) and numeric strings ("0", "1", etc.), case-insensitive
   - `toString()` - returns the string name
   - `toInt()` - returns the raw u3 value
   - `compare()` - compares priorities (lower value = higher priority)
   - `jsonStringify()` / `jsonParse()` / `jsonParseFromValue()` - JSON serialization as integer for beads_rust JSONL compatibility

2. Updated `src/models/mod.zig` to export Priority

3. All validation tests pass:
   - fromInt with valid (0-4) and invalid (5, -1) values
   - fromString with names and numbers
   - Comparison ordering (0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < 4)
   - JSON roundtrip (serializes as integer)
