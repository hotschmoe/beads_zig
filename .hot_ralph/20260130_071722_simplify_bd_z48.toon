# PARSE_ERROR: The code simplification has been completed. Here's the summary:
# PARSE_ERROR: **File modified:** `src/storage/sqlite.zig`
# PARSE_ERROR: Removed code duplication between `exec` and `execAlloc` functions:
# PARSE_ERROR: - Renamed `execAlloc` → `execZ` (following Zig convention for null-terminated string variants)
# PARSE_ERROR: - Refactored `exec` to delegate to `execZ` instead of duplicating the error handling logic
# PARSE_ERROR: This eliminates ~10 lines of duplicated code while preserving identical behavior.
# PARSE_ERROR: All 8 SQLite-specific tests pass. There's a pre-existing flaky test in `src/id/generator.zig` (unrel
# PARSE_ERROR: - The `Statement.db` field (appears unused but is a reasonable pattern for future error message retr
# PARSE_ERROR: - All other code structure - the implementation is already clean and well-organized
# PARSE_ERROR: Would you like me to commit these simplification changes?
